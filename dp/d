Flight Optimization
Problem Description
Tina planned to travel from city A to city B, but unfortunately, due to a strike on that day, many flights were cancelled, with only a few flights still in operation. As always, she aimed to spend as little money as possible while reaching city B within the allotted time.

Considering the available flights between each pair of cities, their take-off and landing times, ticket costs, and the time intervals in which she prefers to travel, determine the minimum amount she needs to spend to reach city B from city A.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 50

1 <= cost of ticket <= 10000

Her journey will be completed on the same day and won't extend past 11:59 Pm.

Hours and minutes will be represented as two-digit numbers, with a leading zero if necessary.

There will be more than one flight between two cities with different timings and / or costs.

Assume that flights are always on time and are never delayed.

Ignore switch-over time between flights at an in-transit location i.e. assume it to be zero.

Input
First line consists of N, denoting the total number of flights operating on that day in different locations.

Next N lines consist of five space separated elements in the format "from to take-off landing cost" where,

from - the departure location of the flight i.e. City A

to - the destination location of the flight i.e. City B

take-off - the time the flight departs

landing - the time the flight arrives

cost - the ticket price

Output
Print a single integer representing the minimum cost Tina needs to spend to travel from city A to city B. If she cannot reach the city B, print "Impossible".
